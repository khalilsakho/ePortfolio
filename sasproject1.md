## üîç Objective

This project explores the empirical relationship between educational attainment and earned income using a detailed dataset of demographic, socioeconomic, and regional variables. The core objective is to determine how different education levels and demographic factors (e.g., age, race, health, citizenship, marital status) influence annual earnings. The analysis uses SAS to generate insights through data visualization, statistical modeling, and regression analysis.

```
## üìä Descriptive Statistics and Dataset Merging

Once the data was cleaned and transformed, a series of SAS procedures were used to examine variable distributions, join datasets, and prepare a finalized dataset for regression analysis.

---

### üìë Summary Statistics

- **`PROC MEANS`** was used to generate descriptive statistics for:
  - The cleaned main dataset (`projdata1`)
  - The household-level file (`cps_hh_file`)
  - The merged dataset containing household and regional information (`TEMP`)
  - The final project dataset (`projdata3`)
  - The final analysis-ready dataset (`e625proj.analysis_data`)

  These procedures calculated:
  - Count (`N`)
  - Number of missing values (`NMISS`)
  - Mean, minimum, and maximum values
  - Rounded to 3 decimal places using `MAXDEC=3`

```sas
PROC MEANS DATA=WORK.projdata1;
TITLE "DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR VARIABLES WITHIN WORK.projdata1";
RUN;

PROC MEANS DATA=e625data.cps_hh_file n nmiss mean min max maxdec=3;
TITLE "DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR VARIABLES WITHIN E625DATA.CPS_HH_FILE";

PROC MEANS DATA=TEMP;
TITLE "DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR VARIABLES WITHIN TEMP";

PROC MEANS DATA= work.projdata3;
TITLE "DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR VARIABLES WITHIN work.projdata3";
RUN;
```

---

### üß© Dataset Merging and Enhancements

- **Sorted and merged multiple datasets** using common IDs (`hhid`, `PERIDNUM`) to enrich the analysis dataset:
  - `hhfile` and `unit6` merged by `hhid` to create `TEMP`, which included geographic regional identifiers.
  - Regions (`south`, `northeast`, `midwest`, `west`) were derived from the `GEREG` variable.
  - Median earned income was calculated at the **state level** (`gestfips`) using `PROC MEANS`, and merged into the dataset as `median_income`.
```sas
PROC SORT DATA=e625data.cps_hh_file out=hhfile; 
BY hhid; 

PROC SORT DATA=e625u6.unit6 out=unit6; 
BY hhid; 
RUN;

DATA temp;
MERGE hhfile unit6;
BY hhid;

	south = 0;
	northeast = 0; 
	midwest = 0; 
	west = 0;
	
	IF GEREG = 1 THEN northeast = 1;
	IF GEREG = 2 THEN midwest = 1;
	IF GEREG = 3 THEN south = 1;
	IF GEREG = 4 THEN west = 1;

	LABEL south = 'South Region';
	LABEL northeast = 'Northeast Region'; 
	LABEL midwest = 'Midwest Region'; 
	LABEL west = 'West Region';

PROC SORT DATA= temp;
BY gestfips;

DATA WORK.projdata2;
MERGE temp medianinc;
BY gestfips;
LABEL median_income = "State Median Income";

PROC MEANS DATA = temp NOPRINT;
BY gestfips;
OUTPUT OUT = medianinc MEDIAN(earned_income) = median_income;
TITLE "DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR VARIABLES WITHIN TEMP by gestfips";
RUN;
	
PROC SORT DATA=work.projdata2 out=projd2; 
BY PERIDNUM; 
  
PROC SORT DATA=e625data.cps_additional_variables out=add_vars; 
BY PERIDNUM;
  
PROC SORT DATA=work.projdata1 out=projd1; 
BY PERIDNUM;
RUN;

DATA WORK.projdata3;
MERGE projd1 projd2 add_vars;
BY PERIDNUM;

RUN; 
```
---

### üßÆ Final Dataset Construction

- Additional variables from `cps_additional_variables` were merged with individual-level data (`projdata1`) and household-level data (`projdata2`) to create a consolidated dataset: `projdata3`.

- **Final analysis dataset**:
  - Saved as `e625proj.analysis_data`
  - Included only key variables necessary for regression and analysis:
    - Income and education dummies
    - Demographics (gender, race, age)
    - Health and marital status
    - Citizenship and region indicators
    - Data quality flags (`miss_demo`, `miss_earn`, `miss_demo_earn`)
    - New features (`educyrs12`, `median_income`)
```sas
DATA e625proj.analysis_data;
SET work.projdata3;
KEEP earned_income educ_eq_hs educ_some_college educ_college educ_ma educ_prof_phd 
	age18 poor_health female black hispanic asian other citizen married 
	divorced separated widowed median_income northeast midwest west educyrs educ_cat miss_demo educyrs12 miss_earn miss_demo_earn;
RUN;
```

- **Final inspection**:
  - Used `PROC CONTENTS` and `PROC MEANS` to ensure the dataset was correctly structured and statistically sound before modeling.
```sas
PROC MEANS DATA= e625proj.analysis_data;
TITLE "DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR FINAL VARIABLES";
PROC CONTENTS DATA= e625proj.analysis_data;
RUN;
```
---

This process ensured the final dataset was comprehensive, statistically validated, and ready for regression analysis.

## üß™ Regression Models
This project estimated multiple regression models to analyze how education and demographic factors affect earned income. The regressions were carefully designed to test for consistency between respondents with and without imputed or allocated data.

---

### üìä Cross-Tabulation of Missing Data

Before modeling, a frequency cross-tabulation (`PROC FREQ`) was conducted using:

```sas
PROC FORMAT;
VALUE missinfo
	0 = "Not Allocated/Imputed"
	1 = "Allocated/Imputed";
PROC FREQ DATA=e625proj.analysis_data NOPRINT;
TABLE miss_demo*miss_earn / NOCOL NOFREQ NOPERCENT OUT=MissingDataCrossTabulations;
WHERE miss_demo = 1 AND miss_earn = 1;
FORMAT miss_demo missinfo. miss_earn missinfo.;  

PROC PRINT DATA=MissingDataCrossTabulations;
TITLE "Table of Cross Tabulations of miss_demo and miss_earn";
RUN;
```
This allowed us to assess how many observations were affected by missing demographic and earnings data. Only individuals without any imputed data (miss_demo = 0, miss_earn = 0) were included in the primary regression to ensure robust and unbiased estimates.

### üìà Primary Regression Model (Without Imputed Data)
```sas
PROC REG DATA= e625proj.analysis_data PLOTS=NONE;
TITLE "Multiple Regression Without Imputed/Allocated Demographic or Earnings Data";
WHERE miss_demo = 0 & miss_earn = 0;
MODEL earned_income = educ_eq_hs educ_some_college educ_college educ_ma educ_prof_phd 
		  age18 poor_health female black hispanic asian other citizen married divorced 
		  separated widowed median_income northeast midwest west;
RUN;
```
This regression estimates the effect of education (as a series of dummy variables) and other demographic controls on earned income. 

### üß™ Joint Hypothesis Test (Education Variables)
To determine whether all education dummies jointly contribute to the model, a TEST statement was used:
```sas
PROC REG DATA= e625proj.analysis_data PLOTS=NONE;
TITLE "Multiple Regression Without Imputed/Allocated Demographic or Earnings Data (T)";
WHERE miss_demo = 0 & miss_earn = 0;
MODEL earned_income = educ_eq_hs educ_some_college educ_college educ_ma educ_prof_phd 
		  age18 poor_health female black hispanic asian other citizen married divorced 
		  separated widowed median_income northeast midwest west;
TEST educ_eq_hs = 0, educ_some_college = 0, educ_college = 0, educ_ma = 0, educ_prof_phd = 0;
RUN;
```
This F-test evaluates whether the education variables collectively improve the model's explanatory power. The result was statistically significant (p < 0.0001), confirming that education is a key predictor of income.

### üß™ Comparison Model (With Imputed Data)
For robustness, the same regression model was re-estimated using only respondents with imputed demographic and earnings data (miss_demo = 1 & miss_earn = 1). This helps assess how missing data treatment may affect conclusions.
```sas
PROC REG DATA= e625proj.analysis_data PLOTS=NONE;
TITLE "Multiple Regression on Imputed/Allocated Demographic or Earnings Data";
WHERE miss_demo = 1 & miss_earn = 1;
MODEL earned_income = educ_eq_hs educ_some_college educ_college educ_ma educ_prof_phd 
		  age18 poor_health female black hispanic asian other citizen married divorced 
		  separated widowed median_income northeast midwest west;
RUN;
```
The direction and magnitude of most coefficients remained similar, but there were small variations in effect sizes‚Äîespecially for variables like gender, marital status, and education. These differences were documented in the final report.

## üìà Key Findings

The results of this analysis reveal several important insights into the relationship between education, demographics, and earned income:

---

### üéì Education and Income

- **Positive Impact of Education**: Each higher level of education is associated with a statistically significant increase in earned income.
  - High School Diploma ‚Üí +$7,888
  - Some College ‚Üí +$12,928
  - Bachelor's Degree ‚Üí +$29,345
  - Master‚Äôs Degree ‚Üí +$47,272
  - Professional/PhD ‚Üí +$69,212

- **Joint Significance**: A hypothesis test confirmed that all education variables collectively contribute significantly to income prediction (p < 0.0001).

---

### üë• Demographic Effects

- **Gender Gap**: Females earn approximately **$25,129 less** than males, controlling for other factors.
- **Race and Ethnicity**:
  - Black individuals earn ~$4,994 less than non-Black, non-Hispanic individuals.
  - Hispanic individuals earn ~$7,014 less on average.
  - Asian and Other race categories showed mixed or statistically insignificant results.
- **Marital Status**:
  - Being married is associated with an income increase of ~$7,542.
  - Divorced and separated individuals also earn more than never-married individuals, though the effect is smaller.
- **Citizenship**: Citizens earn ~$5,150 more than non-citizens on average.

---

### üí° Other Factors

- **Age**: Each year above age 18 is associated with a ~$506 increase in earned income.
- **Health**: Individuals in fair or poor health earn ~$10,831 less than healthier counterparts.
- **Geography**:
  - Living in the **West** region is associated with a ~$3,891 increase in income.
  - No statistically significant income differences were found for the Northeast or Midwest regions.

---

### üß™ Missing Data Sensitivity

- Regression results were robust when comparing models **with** and **without** imputed or allocated data.
- Most key variables remained significant across both models, though effect sizes for some (e.g., gender, health, marital status) varied slightly.

---

### üìä Model Performance

- **R¬≤ = 0.3081**: The final regression model explains about 30.81% of the variance in earned income.
- While this is a moderate level of explanatory power, it strongly supports the role of **education** and **demographics** as key determinants of income.

---

### üìå Conclusion

This analysis confirms the powerful economic impact of educational attainment and highlights how other demographic and regional factors contribute to income inequality in the U.S. labor market. These insights can inform policy discussions around education access, wage equity, and economic opportunity.
