## Impact of Demographic Factors on Earned Income: A Statistical Analysis Using SAS Programming
*[Project Link]((https://khalilsakho.github.io/ePortfolio/sasproject1)*\
This project involved conducting regression analysis and visualizations using SAS programming techniques (including PROC statements, variable creation, etc.) to explore the influence of various demographic factors (such as race, region, citizenship, marital status, and gender) on earned income, with a primary focus on educational attainment. The dataset utilized was sourced from the US Census Current Population Survey 2019 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement.

I performed statistical analyses intending to understand the relationship between demographic variables (e.g., black, white, north, west, male, female, education levels such as less than high school, college degree, master's degree) and their impact on earned income. Visualizations, regression models, and sample aggregations were created to illustrate and quantify these effects. This investigation aimed to uncover insights into how education and other demographic factors contribute to differences in earned income within the surveyed population.
